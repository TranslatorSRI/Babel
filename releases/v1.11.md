# Babel v1.11

- Babel: [Babel v1.11](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/releases/tag/v1.11)

Next release: [2025sep1](./2025sep1.md)
Previous release: [2025mar31](./2025mar31.md)

## Bugfixes
- [MAJOR] @uhbrar discovered that some information content values appeared odd, and @gaurav realized this was
  because the information content comparison was being carried out as a string, not as number. Fixed in
  [PR #467](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/467).
- Minor fixes ([PR #474](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/474), [PR #475](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/475), [PR #476](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/476)).

## New features
- [MAJOR] Added metadata files to all concords (next to each output as `metadata-[concord].yaml`) and
  compendia (`babel_outputs/metadata/[compendia].txt.yaml`) ([PR #459](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/459)).
    - Compendia metadata files are combined from the individual concords being combined. Snakemake
      tracks which metadata files go into which compendia.
    - Helper code allows the prefixes in each concord to be summarized.
    - Eventually, these will extend back to the download files, which will be included in concord files.
    - For now, these files are pretty inconsistently structured, but hopefully we'll structure them better in the future.
- Add a semantic type blocklist to UMLS, which allow us to exclude proteins from chemical ([PR #444](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/444), [PR #469](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/469)).
- Centralize Ubergraph label/synonym downloads so we don't overwrite them from other sources ([PR #438](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/438), [PR #470](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/470)).
- Replaced config.json with config.yaml ([PR #460](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/460)).
- Detect duplicate clique leaders ([PR #431](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/431)).
- Fix BioMart downloads with more than ~10 attributes ([PR #458](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/458)).
- CHEMBL labels that are identical to the CHEMBL ID are now removed ([PR #446](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/446)).
- Added Translator documentation ([PR #292](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/292)).

## Updates
- When working with InChiKeys from UNICHEM, we previously removed any xrefs where two identifiers were mapped to the
  same InChiKey. On delving into this, @bizon realized that we only needed to do this for UNII, KEGG.COMPOUND and
  DrugCentral CURIEs ([PR #508](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/508)).
- Improved NCBIGene label, synonyms and descriptions ([PR #436](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/436)).
- Expanded NCBITaxon synonyms ([PR #425](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/425)).
- Improved how we access Biolink Model Toolkit ([PR #465](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/465)).
- Replace renci-python-image with the GitHub Packages version ([PR #464](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/464)).
- Added database sizes to previous release notes ([PR #442](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/442)).
- Cleaned up redundant code ([PR #472](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/472)).
- Minor updates ([PR #455](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/455/files)).
